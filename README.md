# Loan Default Analysis

Analyze loan default patterns to help loan decision-makers reduce risk and improve lending decisions.

#### Dataset

The dataset contains 255,347 borrowers with details such as:

- Demographics: Age, Education, Marital Status, Employment Type  
- Financials: Income, Credit Score, Debt-to-Income Ratio, Number of Credit Lines  
- Loan Details: Loan Amount, Interest Rate, Loan Term, Loan Purpose, Co-Signer Status  
- Outcome: Default (0 = No, 1 = Yes)  

## Project Goals

- Visualize trends and patterns using bar charts, histograms, pie charts, and heatmaps.  
- Provide insights to support informed lending decisions.

## Key Insights

- Default rate is low (â‰ˆ11.7%), showing a class imbalance.  
- Slight trends: higher education and income correlate with lower default risk; higher loan amounts and interest rates slightly increase default risk.
